# Full-Stack Engineer Mixed Messages Project. 

## Purpose of project:

The goal for coding this project was to create a generator which displayed random messages whenever a button was pressed. I decided to begin this project with a script which ultimately planned out what I was going to do and how I was going to exectute this goal. The main goal(s) of this project was to use my knoweldge of Javascript, using Git version control, the command line, and to develop this project locally on my computer. I used VScode to help me in this process. 

## Features:

Among the features that were used in this project, they were strongly correlated mostly using CSS. Once I figured out how to use a loop to iterate through all the message in the array, the goal thereafter was to display it on the browser. Upon this step, I struggled figuring out how I should tackle this, but I then decided to use my resources to help me out. I ultimately figured out what I needed to do and I began to take action. This projects features are strongly associated with:
1. Styling, 
2. Hover's,
3. and being able to use the links on my navigation to switch and head towards one my Adobe portfolio websites. 

This in itself made the website be much more presentable than having a static page.
